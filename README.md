# Bacteria Collection

## Overview
In this project I built three graphs using plotly.js to provide each volunteer the opportunity to find his or her id number and the visuals corresponding to that id, as well as a panel I completed earlier.  The volunteer will find a bar graph displaying the top 10 bacteria found in his or her navel (from most to least), a bubble chart displaying the top 10 bacteria, with the most prevalent one having the largest radius, and a gauge chart showing how many times per week the navel is washed.  Improbable Foods scientists are looking for a species of bacteria they can use to manufacture synthetic beef, and these graphs show a) if that bacteria was found in the volunteer's navel and b) how prevalent is was in the navel.
